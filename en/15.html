    <h1>FIDT wins the lawsuit and Jiang Porcellio returns to the court</h1>
    <article>
        <p>Before the start of the Tokyo Sports Competition, APT Tic-Tac-Toe player Jiang Porcellio was banned by the Tokyo Sports Organizing Committee for making inappropriate remarks. FIDT felt that the penalty was excessive and did not comply with the relevant regulations, so we filed a complaint with the relevant authorities. Today, we won the case! The organizing committee admitted that the penalty was excessive and changed the penalty from the ban on Jiang Porcellio to deducting 1 point from Jiang Porcellio's group stage points. FIDT believes that the change of judgment is reasonable, and we would like to express our appreciation to the Tokyo Games Organizing Committee for being able to correct it. We encourage Tic-Tac-Toe chess players to express their views and demands in a civilized rather than insulting manner, and don't speak as rudely as the Er-leng(means rude in Chinese) youth.</p>
