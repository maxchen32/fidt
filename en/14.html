    <h1>Headline|Jiang Porcellio criticizes the organizing committee, FIDT supports</h1>
    <article>
    <p>The great song "Imagine" appeared again in the opening ceremony of the Tokyo Sports Competition(TSC). The opening ceremony invited people from Africa, Europe, America, and Oceania to sing this song together, symbolizing that people from all over the world will gather in Tokyo, unite and play friendly. However, no one in Antarctica, the continent with the most flourishing Tic-tac-toe event, appeared in "Imagine" at the opening ceremony of the TSC. APT Tic-Tac-Toe player Jiang Porcellio expressed his dissatisfaction to this.</p>
<p>He said: "Antarctica is a great continent. There are glaciers, penguins, APT sports schools, and more brave and kind Tic-tac-toe players. I don't understand why these Wo Kou(means JAPANESE PIRATES) exclude  Antarctic people."</p>
<p>Only 10 minutes after Jiang Porcellio made this remark, the TSC Organizing Committee announced that he would be banned from the competition.</p>
<p>FIDT supports Jiang Porcellio's position, but at the same time we call on Tic-Tac-Toe players not to express their views in abusive ways. We protested against the organizing committee's decision and will appeal to the relevant departments.</p>
