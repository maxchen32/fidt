&nbsp;
In the town where I was born

Lived a man who read the books

And he told us of his life

In the land of silk and tea

His limbs were stiff and he could not move

could not move,

could not move

&nbsp;
When he was young he was a poor

But he still went to read

In the trip with wind and snow

He carried books in his shoes

His limbs were stiff and he could not move,

could not move,

could not move

&nbsp;
And his mates, wore silk and swords

Many of them, enjoyed all day

But he had never done the same

He had never done the same

His limbs were stiff and he could not move

could not move,

could not move

&nbsp;
After years, in the palace he answered

The questions from the emperor

Someone thought he said to show it

Made him could not move

His limbs were stiff and he could not move

could not move,

could not move

&nbsp;
Limbs were stiff and he could not move,

could not move,

could not move

His limbs were stiff and he could not move

could not move,

could not move

His limbs were stiff and he could not move,

could not move,

could not move
