In the town where I was born

Lived a man who read the books 

And he told us of his life 

In the land of silk and tea 

His limbs were stiff and he could not move 

could not move, 

could not move 

&nbsp;
When he was young he was a poor

But he still went to read 

In the trip with wind and snow 

He carried books in his shoes 

His limbs were stiff and he could not move, 

could not move, 

could not move 

&nbsp;
And his mates, wore silk and swords 

Many of them, enjoyed all day 

But he had never done the same 

He had never done the same

His limbs were stiff and he could not move 

could not move, 

could not move 

&nbsp;
After years, in the palace he answered 

The questions from the emperor 

Someone thought he said to show it 

Made him could not move 

His limbs were stiff and he could not move 

could not move, 

could not move 

&nbsp;
Limbs were stiff and he could not move, 

could not move, 

could not move 

His limbs were stiff and he could not move 

could not move, 

could not move 

His limbs were stiff and he could not move, 

could not move, 

could not move
